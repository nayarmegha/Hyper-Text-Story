<h2>He needs some Deodorant</h2>

Demon visited me multiple times after that. Everything was going well...urm...almost. I just had an issue with his utter lack of hygiene. Now, I'm not very particular on that but I could tell that he really needed a shower so I offered he use my shower.

I don't think he's going to come back.
